# In Class

## Goals

1. Respond to comments on homework and ask questions
   (while we wait for everyone to arrive)
2. Request collaboration rights to a repo
3. Use git to pull down from a remote repo
4. Make a branch off of that remote repo
5. Push up to that branch
O. (optional) set up alternative terminal such as zsh / oh-my-zsh

## Commands Used

note: $ means this is something you run in the terminal - you don't type that piece

```
$ git pull

$ git branch

$ git add

$ git commit

$ git push
```
